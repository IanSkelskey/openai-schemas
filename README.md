# OpenAI Schemas Repository

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to storing and sharing JSON schemas for custom GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers). These schemas are designed to define the structure and expected data for various APIs, making it easier to integrate and work with different services using custom GPTs.

## Contents

### GitHub API Schema

- `github.json`: This schema defines the structure for fetching details of a specified GitHub repository. It outlines the necessary parameters, such as repository owner and name, and the expected response format, including repository details like name, description, creation date, and more.

### Spotify API Schema

- `spotify.json`: This file provides a schema for the Spotify API. It includes structures for retrieving information about Spotify users, their playlists, and tracks. The schema details the required parameters and the format of the expected response, including playlist details, track information, and user data.

## Usage

These schemas can be used to create custom GPTs tailored for specific APIs. By defining the expected data structure, these schemas help in ensuring that the custom GPTs can interact effectively with the APIs, providing accurate and relevant responses.
